**Problem 1:**
<p>I am officially submitting the problem and the solution is fully working.<br>
The challenging thing about this problem was the coordination of rows and columns being ordered differently in the code. Between that and the Wumpus examples, it was fun keeping them all separate.
<br>I love sudoku so seeing how constraint can be used to solving puzzles is very cool! I got my puzzle to run but it was overriding the initial values. So after the clarification from the professor, I got it to work with the initialValues as a constraint. I probably spent about 8 hours on this, but that was mostly due to the confusion of the provided code and figuring out the coordinates and how to translate it. </p>

<br>

**Problem 2:**
<p>I am officially submitting the problem and the solution is fully working.<br>
I had a lot of fun doing this problem, I always wondered how NFL or NBA create the schedules every year and after learning about Job Scheduling, it all makes sense. I spent about 8 hours on this but made great strides after getting help from my professor. <br>
There was a bug that was throwing my code off and it took me forever to figure out. I used range when adding variables to the constraint and I forgot range was inclusive and was using range from 0 to 4. That’s why my number of solutions was off. I kept trying to fix my Order Constraints and Mutex Constraints but turns out that wasn’t the bug. Overall, great learning experience with matrixes in Python.</p>

<br>

**Problem 3:**
<p>I am officially submitting the problem and the solution is fully working.<br>
I was having a lot of trouble understanding Propositional Logic and Resolutions. The slides were good but moved too fast. I study best with a similar example that I can follow in class and even outside of class. So the “05_prop_logic NEW” slides were tremendously helpful. The step by step to the Solution with the table was really helpful. I did this problem to study for the midterm and it took me about 3 hours to understand Resolution/CNF and be able to do it.<br>
What threw me off about this problem was a typo on the Assignment 2 itself. The sentence, “If the unicorn is either immortal or a mammal, then it is norned.” I reviewed the propositional symbols and I did not see “norned” anywhere. I assumed that it was short for “not horned”. But I looked down at my keyboard and realized the “h” and “n” were near each other so it must be a typo. I confirmed by checking the textbook.</p>

<br>

**Problem 4:**
<p>I am officially submitting the problem and the solution is fully working. You said to delete "this cell and above" but when I do, the program gives me an error. So I will keep the prove function there. <br>
Prove theorem in python is new to me so that was the challenging part. I had to review the code to see what each line does. When I first read the assignment, of course my mind goes back to “let’s solve this with arithmetic”. But the professor said don’t and helped us with the adjacency method. So I used that example and see how I can apply that to visited. It was basically trial and error using the adjacency method as a guide to get the code to run.<br>
Then comes debugging. I used ~pit instead of -pit and that kept giving me false for pit at (2,1). But really cool to see how the prove theorem works. </p>

<br>

**Overall:**
<p>This assignment has a lot of variety that covers a lot of the stuff we do in class. It was helpful in understanding the lecture material. The due date extension made it less stressful, so thank you for that.</p>
