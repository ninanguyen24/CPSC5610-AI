    "1.  Since all tasks take three time units, it's easiest to partition time into \"buckets\" each of which is three time units long.  For example, bucket 1 is the interval between t=0 and t=2 inclusive, bucket 1 is t=3 to t=5 inclusive.  You will notice from the **printSolution** code that my solver does that bucketing, then when it prints the solution it converts the time bucket number to a real point in time\n",
    "2.  There are only two kinds of constraints:  order constraints (one task must come after another) and mutex constraints (two tasks must not be scheduled at the same time).   If you write helper functions for those two constraints, it will simplify your code a lot."
