    "\n",
    "You will be given a data set, and will apply the techniques we have studied in class to predict a numeric response variable, and to evaluate alternative solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps will be\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Exploratory data analysis and evaluation\n",
    "  * Find and correct outliers and missing values\n",
    "  * Find nonlinear relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable, and transform the input appropriately\n",
    "  * Find correlation in the independent variables and decide how if at all to address it\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply learning techniques.  In each case you will train the algorithm and evaluate it using the *test* $R^2$ statistic.  You will explore different hyperparameter values to find the model you think will maximize test $R^2$ for an evaluation data set.  You will do this for\n",
    "  * Linear regression exploring different variable sets using regular stepwise regression, Lasso, and Ridge Regression\n",
    "  * Decision tree regression exploring different tree depths\n",
    "  * Random forests and boosting exploring different parameter sets\n",
    "  * Neural networks \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Choosing the best method.  You will choose one algorithm and parameter settings you are most confident with, and write a function that enables it to evaluate a new data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When I evaluate your solution, I will call this function on a new set of data, and score your solution (partially) on its results\n",

    "#### Note on your prediction functions\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that for each technique, you are asked to provide a \"prediction\" function that takes an **X** matrix as input.  This **X** matrix will be in the format of the original data set you loaded.  So if in your data cleaning phase you added or deleted or transformed column values, each of these prediction functions must make the same transformations on its input prior to calling you model.\n"

    "### Loading and Cleaning the Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is in a file named **data_set.csv** -- it has 11 independent variables -- some are numeric and some categorical -- and a single numeric response variable $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first cleaning / analysis phase you should do the following\n",
    "1. Look for outlier values.  When you find outliers, you can do one of two things\n",
    "  * Throw away the data row altogether.  If many variables in the row seem uncommon, it is probably best to delete the row.\n",
    "  * Replace the outlier with a \"reasonable\" value -- probably the mean or median value for that variable.   The reasoning is that the benefit of keeping the row outweighs the error introduced by having a made-up value in one variable\n",
    "2. Look for missing values.  Most algorithms will throw away data rows that have *any* missing value.  You can just delete the row (especially if many values are missing) or assign it a \"reasonable\" value -- probably the mean value for that variable.  If there is an attribute that has many missing values, it is probably best to delete the whole column\n",
    "3. Look for nonlinear relationships.   Most important is finding nonlinear relationships between one of the $x$ variables, and the $y$ variable.  For example, maybe $y$ depends on $x^2$ or $\\log(x)$ rather than on $x$. In that case you need to guess at that relationship, and replace $x$ with a transformed value.  For example if it looks like $y$ depends on $x^2$ then just a column of $x^2$ values.  The easiest way to see these relationships is to do a pair plot between your X variables and y, including a trend line.  \"Well behaved\" $x$ variables tend to show no pattern except for (roughly) following the trend line.  If you are seeing other shapes, or sudden jumps in the behavior of $y$ as $x$ changes, something nonlinear is going on.\n",
    "4. Look for correlations among the $x$ variables.  If you find a correlation you may want to delete one of the correlated variables, but it is not necessary -- you will have to experiment to see if it improves your predictions.  To find correlations, you can use the pair plot, or a correlation matrix, or a heatmap -- there are examples of all of these in the class notebooks.\n",
    "5. Transform categorical variables to dummy (0/1 coded) variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this phase should be a matrix ${\\bf X}$ and a vector ${\\bf y}$ that comprise your training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember though, if you ever need to use your learned function to a new ${\\bf X}$ data set, you need to transform the input ${\\bf X}$ matrix the same way your transformed your test set -- otherwise your learned function will give bad results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it looks like this cleaning phase happens before any analysis/learning, the two processes are interleaved.  Start with a simple linear regression model and do minimal cleaning on your data set, just to the point the LR model works.  Then you can test more subtle transformations to see if they make your models perform better."
