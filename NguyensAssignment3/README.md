**Problem 1.1:**
<p>The solution is fully working and we spent about 2 hours on this.<br>
The challenging thing about this problem was understanding the long instructions and the magic of the provided code. The professor's hint made it a lot easier though.</p>

<br>

**Problem 1.2:**
<p>The solution is fully working and we spent about 2 hours on this.<br>
Similar to the first problem, the challenging thing about this problem was grasping what each provided functions did. Since the code was already provide, a lot of print statements were used to see what they did in order for us to apply that into a solution.<br>
While using the autograder to test our code, we kept getting a timed out on the 4th test case but the first three passed, so we thought there was a bug. In the end, we are not sure what the issue was but restarting Spyder and Anaconda seemed to solve the problem.</p>

<br>

**Problem 1.3:**
<p>The solution is fully working and we spent about 3 hours on this.<br>
This was the toughest one in the pacman problems. There was just a lot of underlying code we don't see or functions we use that have complicated implementation. So it was overwhelming when we look at them. Doing one step at a time made it easier and less hectic.</p>

<br>

**Problem 2:**
<p>The Solution is fully working and we spent about 6 hours on this.<br>
This was the toughest problem. We understand the concept of probability and condition probability, but translating that into code was the problem. It was also hard because there's no solution for us to compare our work with so the ambiguity made us question ourselves multiple time.<br>
We both create separate conditional probability tables to make sure that our code was coming up with the right values in the end. </p>

<br>

**Overall:**
<p>Working on this assignment with a partner was fun. The pacman problems improved our reading and understanding other people's code. It was cool to work with the Pomegranate package to apply the probability concepts. </p>
