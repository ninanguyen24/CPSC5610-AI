* ###### Question 1:
<dd>This solution is working. This one took the longest between 1-4 because I have to read the other codes and understand what they do. For Pacman problem 1-5, I noticed that the description said I can create a master search but I wasn’t sure if that complies with your rubric by creating another method, so I didn’t use that idea.</dd>
* ###### Question 2:
<dd>This solution is working.</dd>
* ###### Question 3:
<dd>This solution is working.</dd>
* ###### Question 4:
<dd>This solution is working. Debugging was fun with this problem. The error I kept receiving was – ‘int’ object is not callable. And it turns out my I was assigning heuristics to “heuristic”. Now I know.</dd>
* ###### Question 5:
<dd>Another error I kept getting with this problem was that BFS was not implemented in Search.py. I thought it was because my successor function in the Corner’s problem was not implemented properly. Turns out that I used a set() to hold the visited coordinates and it was throwing SearchAgent.py off.</dd>
* ###### Pancake Sort:
<dd>The solution is fully working. This was the most challenging. I implemented with the assumption that the array won’t have duplicate elements and that 0 is the smallest element. I am not very familiar with Jupyter so there was a learning curve with this assignment as well.</dd>
<dd>I emailed the professor for help with my program when I was getting errors and freaking out about the due date. It turns out I was over thinking the problem (sometimes doing too much is not good!). I reviewed the Block’s program and noticed the deepcopy comment. After some trial and error, I got my code to work from Pstate to Array (I had the most trouble with this).
I left in the FindMaxElement in my code because I was playing around with heuristics. By finding the max value and seeing how many items after it are lower, I can use that number as a h(n). But I didn’t get the implementation to work.</dd>

* ###### Overall:
<dd>This project took over 30+ hours. I was learning python half the time and learning algorithm the other half. I usually spend 8 hours every weekend on this and even use time at work to write trot down ideas and pseudocode. 
I had a lot of fun seeing how the different algorithms played out in Pacman. After this project, I started to see how AI are applied to the real world and how else it can be applied. This was a great way to get introduced to AI, I can’t see what else we’ll learn in the class.</dd>
